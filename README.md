# Light Programming Language

> Light is a programming language that compiles to JavaScript.

I made this compiler because I wanted to learn more about compilers. it is largely an experiment meant for learning.
**It is not intended for real use.**

## Example

```ts
var x: string = "Hello";
let y: number = 1;

function main(a: string) {
  return a;
}
```
